## Abstract
In recent years, with the increasing awareness of climate change and public health, especially concerning vulnerable populations, the significance of air quality has taken center stage in global discourse. Air pollution is a pressing issue affecting billions of people worldwide and has been linked to severe health conditions, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and even premature mortality. Beyond individual health, air pollution challenges global ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and economic stability, necessitating air quality monitoring and management. 

The AQI, or Air Quality Index, has emerged as a critical metric for assessing and reporting air quality in a given area. The AQI translates complex measurements of various pollutants—such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO)—into a single, easily understandable scale that informs the public about potential health risks.

While reporting real-time AQI values is an invaluable asset for reporting public awareness and enabling immediate health precautions, it is equally crucial to predict AQI levels, at reasonable time steps ahead, for proactive planning and mitigation strategies. Predictive models enable governments and organizations to anticipate hazardous conditions, issue timely warnings, and implement measures to reduce exposure and emissions. For instance, forecasting spikes in pollutant levels can guide traffic regulations, industrial activity, and public advisories, minimizing the adverse impacts on health and the environment.

This project (as well as the code) implements both real-time and predictive capabilities for AQI analysis alongside other vital variables, such as temperature, that can provide equally insightful data.
